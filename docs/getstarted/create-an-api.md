# Create a resource API

Resources is content [CRUD](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRUD), one resorce have all routes need for get, create, update and delete your contents (model)

Routes generated by resources are extendable. Ex: you can set new routes for things like get content count

> Tip: Use **we routes** command to list all routes with suport to filters, see options ẁith **we routes -h**

## 1- Create one app

Tip:

```sh
yo wejs:app
```

And follow all instructions for set database and first user (optional)

## 2- Make the `post` resource

Lets see how to make a resource with generator-wejs:

This will generate the controller, model and resource routes.

Inside one project or plugin tip:

```sh
yo wejs:resource post title:string:allowNull=false teaser:text body:text published:boolean
```

> **yo wejs:resource post** generate the post model and **title:string:allowNull=false teaser:text body:text published:boolean** will be model attributes

And done!

TIP: Use `we routes` command to list and filter all routes in your project.

By default this will make:

```
## API:
post /post # create
get /post # list, find
get /post/:postId # find one
put /post/:postId # update one
delete /post/:postId # delete one

```

And if **we-plugin-view** is installed will generate:

```
## API:
post /post # create
get /post # list, find
get /post/:postId # find one
put /post/:postId # update one
delete /post/:postId # delete one
## pages:
get /post/create
get /post/:postId/edit
post /post/:postId/edit
get /post/:postId/delete
post /post/:postId/delete

```

## 3- Run project in development mode

```sh
we run
```

## 4- Make the Swagger documentation

In project folder tip:

```sh
yo wejs:doc
```
